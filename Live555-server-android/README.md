LIVE555 Streaming Media is a set of open source C++ libraries for multimedia streaming. The libraries support open standards such as RTP/RTCP and RTSP for streaming, and can also manage video RTP payload formats such as H.265, H.264, MPEG, VP8, and DV, and audio RTP payload formats such as MPEG, AAC, AMR, AC-3 and Vorbis. They can easily be extended to support additional audio and video codecs, and can also be used to build basic RTSP or SIP clients and servers, and have been used to add streaming support to existing media player applications.
